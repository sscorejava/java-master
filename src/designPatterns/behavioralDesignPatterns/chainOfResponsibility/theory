avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple 
objects a chance to handle the request



Advantage of Chain of Responsibility Pattern

    It reduces the coupling.
    It adds flexibility while assigning the responsibilities to objects.
    It allows a set of classes to act as one; events produced in one class can be sent to other handler classes with the help of composition.




Usage of Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

    When more than one object can handle a request and the handler is unknown.
    When the group of objects that can handle the request must be specified in dynamic way.
