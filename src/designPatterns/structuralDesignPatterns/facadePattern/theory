just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, 
therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client

Advantage of Facade Pattern

    It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
    It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

    
    
Usage of Facade Pattern:

    When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
    When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
