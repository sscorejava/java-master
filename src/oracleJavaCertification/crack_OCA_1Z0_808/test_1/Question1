Which of the following are true?
--------------------------------

 a: Java is platform dependent but JVM is platform independent
 
 b: Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent
 
 c: Java byte code is platform dependent but JVM is platform independent
 
 d: Java byte code is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Answer : b, d
 
 Explanation :
  
 Java follows Write Once and Run anywhere policy (WORA). 
 i.e Once we write a java program, we can run on any platform without making any changes. 
 First Java Source File will be compiled into ByteCode. 
 Bytecode is an intermediate and machine independent code. 
 JVM will interpret byte code into the corresponding machine dependent code and executes that machine code. 
 Hence Java is Platform independent Bytecode is Platform Independent But JVM is Platform Dependent
